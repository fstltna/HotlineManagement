# Hotline Management Console (1.1.1)
Allows you to manage your Hotline server process with a text based UI

---

Install all the dependancies by running this command:

- ./installdeps

Run "hmc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.hmcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within hmc itself.

You also need to have my Hotline Startup Script and Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (HotlineManagement) into your path so you can just run "hmc" from the command line. You can check for and install updates using option #12 in hmc.
